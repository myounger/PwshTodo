SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PwshTodo allows you to create simple markdown files locally for tracking tasks

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module creates a series of markdown files locally in the $ENV:USERPROFILE/Documents/Task folder. These files can then be edited 
    using the functions in this module. These todo files are created in the markdown language and use the task item indicates of [ ] for
    in progress tasks and [X] for completed tasks
